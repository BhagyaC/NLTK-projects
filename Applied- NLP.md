# Goal 
Ability to process the hardness information from a large corpus of text with a very little manual intervention

## NLP is hard
- many way of representation
- idioms, metaphors, sarcasm
- mixing of visual cues
-ambigeous in nature
etc

## NLP tasks
- informatin extraction
- Information retrieval 
- Language generation
- Text clustering

- Text classification
- Machine traslation - one langauge to another
- Grammar chechers

## Operation on a text corpus
 - corpus is a collection of documents
 - identify the paragraphs and sentences
 - Extract the tokens
 - Count the number of tokens/words in the corpus
 - find the vocabulary count
 - find the patterns of words 
 - Term frequency 
 - type token ratio
 - inverse document frequency

 ## Probability and NLP
 -  probability comes with the prediction of the next token and make decision
 -  make some decision with certain degree of uncertainity
 - probability of the sentence
 - probability of the next token
 -  likely hood of the words

 Goal - compute the probability of the sequence of  word - ie the likely hood of the word
 Task - to predict the next word using the probability , find the next word using the given context
