## Machine translation

- If we can convert the sentence to a fixed length vector then goes to the traslation part
- word --> syntatic structure --> sematic structure --> interligua (knowledge representation) --> target language
-  Automatic machine translation is a hard problem and parallel corpora aid the devolopment of the AMT
-   We are using the alignment of words to translation - MT from example
-  MT from data - statistical ML - word and phrase based translation
- Neural ML
- MT using artificial neural network
- Hypothesis generation - something related to the text mining
- seemingly unconnected resources used to created some new hypothesis
- We are trying to solve why using what and how
- The gather the statistical information from the corpus --> understand the word from the context and context from the word --> encode the contexual information about the word(embedding) --> predict the next word based on the context(language model) --> encode the sentence (RNN) --> predict how likely a new sentence could be valid sentence --> learn to automatically translate from one language to another
