# Artificial neural network
- Another mechanism to process the corpus and find the insights on them 
- Why we need ANN?
- In standard of algorithm the steps to solve the problem are well defined
- But the rules are unambiguous
- The probelm with the subtle input can't follow the standard algorithm 
- train with examples and system learns from it
- The learning is the key to the ambiguous world
- The models are not going to being a static one and we have to keep learning with them 

### Classification 

- classification is the task of assigning predifiens dis-joint categories to objects 
- based on teh tuple given we have to find a line/ plane that seperate the two classes
- the classification model will find the fuction that will connect the input variable to the output class
- If the inputs are linear seperable then classification model find the fuction as a line and seperate the fuction as two spaces
- the classes are disjoint and the input should fall in to only one class
- ex) decision boundary for OR gate
- ex) decision boundary for sentiments
- There are problems that are not linear seperable problems(eg)XOR)
